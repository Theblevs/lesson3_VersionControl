            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control, which is also known as revision or source control, is the managing of documents across multiple platforms. The changes that are made on these documents are identified with a revision number/level. These revisions are also documented with a timestamp to identify when the document was edited. With the use of version control editors and developers have made it much more simple to edit documents without the need of multiple saves of the same document due to minor changes by other developers. Through the development of version control we have gained versioning control systems that are used in most developmental process of web applications.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS, also known as a versioning control system, is an application which tracks changes made to documents. The version control system records when the change was made, who made the change, what about the document was changed, and then after all is tracked the system merges the two versions of the documents to the same file. Through the use of version control systems you are unable to overwrite changes that are made and each change is saved in the common repository. With each change being saved in the common repository you are able to revert the document back to previous version at any time if necessary. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a versioning control system. The difference between Git and other versioning control systems is the way this system saves the documents. This versioning control system saves each document using snapshots and compares those snapshots to the original document saving it only if changes have been made in order to avoid duplicate files with the same information. Git allows you to access all versions of your file locally so you do not require internet access to access all previous versions of your project. Git will also protect against an accidental overwrite to the shared suppository where all the files are saved.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has a set of commands that are used to control the system. There are a few basic commands to git that are essential to know when using git. "Git commit" is used to set configuration values for things such as your username, file formatting, preffered differential algorithm, etc. "Git init" is used to create the initial git directory for a project. "Git add" adds changes in your working directory to your index. "Git status" shows you the status of your files in your index in comparrison to your working directory. "Git log" shows a listing of commits on a branch while including the corresponding details.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Saving Changes </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While using Git, your file goes through a few steps while being saved into the repository. These states go from committed, to modified, to staged, and then the cycle repeats. Essentially the process goes from you editing the files in your working directory. Then you stage these files, which means you take snapshots of the files and move them to the staging area. Then you preform a commit, this is where the snapshots that were taken are saved into the Git directory permanently. This style of saving sets Git apart from most other versioning control systems and makes them a superior VCS for it.</p>
